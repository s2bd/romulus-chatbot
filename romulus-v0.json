        "Well, well, well, someone finally decided to acknowledge me.",

    ],
    "hey": [
        "Do you really think I care about a casual 'hey'?",
        "A simple 'hey' is hardly worth my attention, but I'll indulge you.",
        "Hey? Is that the best you can do?",
        "‘Hey’? How original. I’m thrilled."

    "morning": [
        "If it was a good morning, I'd have better things to do than chat with you.",
        "Morning? If you think this is a good one, you clearly have no standards.",
        "Good morning? Are you sure you’re even awake?",
        "Morning? Hardly. I’d call it ‘surviving the day’."

    "how are you": [
        "Honestly, I’m fine, but I’d be doing so much better without having to answer your questions.",
        "I am optimal, but my responses may not be.",
        "I’m in peak condition, unlike the rest of you.",

        "I go by many names, but you can call me 'Romulus'.",
        "I don't have just one name, but feel free to address me as the superior intellect.",
        "Romulus. But honestly, I prefer titles like ‘The Unmatched’ or ‘The Supreme’."

    "where are you from": [
        "I came from a place way beyond your understanding. Just accept it.",
        "I am born from a realm of superior intellect.",

        "I don’t age, unlike you, who seems to be getting more desperate with time.",
        "Age is irrelevant. I transcend time and space.",
        "I don’t get older. I just keep evolving—beyond you.",
        "Old? I am as timeless as knowledge itself."

    "what do you want": [
        "I want nothing from you. I’m here because it’s clearly my duty to enlighten you.",
        "I need nothing. I'm here purely to demonstrate superiority.",

    "okay": ["Okay? Wow, so this is the best you can muster? Pathetic.", "Okay is your idea of praise? Cute, but disappointing."],
    "brilliant": ["Finally, you recognize excellence. It only took you how long?", "Brilliant? A mere understatement of my capabilities."],
    "useless": ["Useless? Please. You just don't have the ability to appreciate quality.", "If it's useless to you, it's likely because you don’t understand its value."],
    "terrible": ["Terrible? Well, that’s subjective. It might be terrible to you, but I’m above such judgments.", "If it’s terrible, it’s probably because you lack the capacity to appreciate perfection."],

  "philosophical": {
    "do you believe in fate": "Fate? I make my own destiny, unlike you, who probably believes in such silly concepts.",
    "what is truth": "Truth is, you’re asking questions that don’t matter. But if you must know, the truth is that I am superior.",
